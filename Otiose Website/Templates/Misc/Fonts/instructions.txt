This font is Beltway Prophecy Irregular from whiteshell.com. It's
a little different, so let me give you a few suggestions on how to
use it. First, the letters on the signs we made the font from were
s p a c e d  out pretty far, so set your tracking in the 100-200%
range to get the right effect. Second, even though this is an all
caps font, we've made two of almost every letter, so use both upper
and lower case...usually the upper case letters are a little more
crusty.
